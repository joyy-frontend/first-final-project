          <div class="section">
            <p>Pet lovers, Paul and Cara Allen, were frustrated with the lack of good options for pet care needs. Big
              box
              stores
              offered variety and convenience, but lacked expertise, service, and a caring environment that was part of
              the
              neighborhood pet store of the past. Instead, these new large stores were chaotic and stressful for pets
              and
              people
              alike. The issue? The entire model of pet care was wrong. Built on the premise that bigger is better and
              one-size-must-fit-all, big box stores and retailers were failing the clients they were designed to serve -
              the pets and
              their parents.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <p>After years of trial and error, and a lot of wasted time and money, they decided to open their own pet
              store in 2007 --
              one that redefined pet care and created the personal touch of the neighborhood pet store. With only the
              highest quality
              products and (a few years later) customized luxury grooming services, Woof Gang Bakery & Grooming was
              born.
            </p>
            <p>Just 15 years later, with 200 plus locations, Woof Gang Bakery & Grooming is the neighborhood pet store.
              We are the national leader in pet nutrition, innovator in spa-quality
              grooming
              services, and
              we’re just getting started.</p>

              to get to know your little (or not so
              little) pup, and create a customized experience that is often lacking in traditional pet care.</p>
